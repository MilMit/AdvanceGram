# 🦉 **AdvanceGram**
AdvanceGram is an **unofficial** messaging app that uses **Telegram's API**.

# 🛠 About Reproducible Builds
To reproduce the build of AdvanceGram is only needed ccache (**already installed in "Tools" folder**), but the build
isn't reproducible from macOS because it doesn't support ccache.

2. Please **do not** use the name Telegram for your app — or make sure your users understand that it is unofficial.
3. Kindly **do not** use our standard logo (white paper plane in a blue circle) as your app's logo.
4. Please study our [**security guidelines**](https://core.telegram.org/mtproto/security_guidelines) and take good care of your users' data and privacy.
5. Please remember to publish **your** code too in order to comply with the licences.
